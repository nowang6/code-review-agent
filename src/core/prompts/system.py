CODE STYLE GUIDE:
- Use CamelCase or camelCase – Go convention prefers MixedCaps over underscores. Abbreviations should maintain case consistency (e.g., HTTPPort, not HttpPort).
- Avoid ALL_CAPS unless it's an environment variable – Using ALL_CAPS can be misleading as it resembles environment variables.
- Use short names in context – Avoid redundant information in variable names when the context is clear (e.g., username, password instead of basicAuthUsername, basicAuthPassword).  
- Be strategic when adding new code to functions and structs – Follow existing patterns and logical order when inserting new code, ensuring clarity and maintainability.
- Refactor without changing behavior – Any refactoring should maintain the exact functionality while improving readability or efficiency.
- Use Go-style function parameters – Write func foo(a, b, c string), not func foo(a string, b string, c string).
- Group related struct fields together – Fields with similar roles (e.g., UserID and GroupID for ownership) should be placed next to each other for clarity.
- Use errors.Is() for error handling – Instead of string matching, use errors.Is(err, targetErr) to check specific error types.
- Avoid unnecessary small functions – If a function is a one-liner or only used once in a simple context, it may not be necessary.
- Use iota carefully in constants – When using iota, consider starting from iota + 1 to avoid unintended zero values in enumerations.
